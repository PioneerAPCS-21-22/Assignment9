# Assignment 9

For this program you will be creating some methods to manipulate integers in a few ways, which include:

1. Getting the sum of the digits
2. Reversing the digits

You will also create a method that prints a greeting and shows the instructions.

First ask the user for their name and take input. Then, call a method that will greet them by name and then give instructions for what to do next. 

## Sample Outputs

```
Welcome. What is your name? James Gosling
Hello, James Gosling.
Enter an integer between 1000 and 9999: 1967
Sum of digits: 23
Reversed: 7691
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
